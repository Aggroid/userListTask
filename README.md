# React + Vite Project

This project is a setup for React working in Vite with HMR, ESLint rules, and fast refresh capabilities using [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) and [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   First, you need to clone the repository to your machine. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone [URL to your repository]
   cd [Your Project Directory]
   ```

   Replace `[URL to your repository]` with the actual URL to your repo and `[Your Project Directory]` with the name of your project folder.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Once inside your project directory, you can install the necessary project dependencies using:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will read the `package.json` file in the project and install all required libraries and dependencies.

## Running the Project Locally

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server, and the project should open in your default web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Build for Production

To generate a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
